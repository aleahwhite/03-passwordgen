# Challenge Three - Password Generator

## Description:
The motivation for this website was to create a semi-personalized password generator using JavaScript. This generator will give a series of prompts for the user to chose from like the number of characters (8-128), special characters or not, and lower/uppercase characters or not. It will then generate a randomized and secure password for the user to copy.

## Installation:

This website is used for anyone that wants to generate a secure and randomized password, where they can choose how many characters (8-128) and what kind of characters they would or wouldn't like in their password.
